   üëâ https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html

2. Choose the version under **"Windows (MSVC)"**, e.g.:  
   `wkhtmltopdf-0.12.6-1.msvc.exe`

3. Run the installer and install it to the default location:  
   `C:\Program Files\wkhtmltopdf\bin\wkhtmltopdf.exe`

## üß† Set Environment Variable

To allow your Python script to find `wkhtmltopdf`, add its path as a **user environment variable**.

### Steps:

1. Open **Start Menu** ‚Üí search for **"Environment Variables"**
2. Click on **"Edit the system environment variables"**
3. In the window that opens, click **Environment Variables...**
4. Under **User variables**, click **New**
   - **Variable name**: `WKHTMLTOPDF_PATH`  
   - **Variable value**: `C:\Program Files\wkhtmltopdf\bin\wkhtmltopdf.exe`
5. Click OK ‚Üí OK ‚Üí OK
6. Restart your code editor or terminal so the environment variable takes effect.

---

## üß™ Test Your Setup

You can test if the variable is set correctly by running this small Python snippet:

```python
import os
print("WKHTMLTOPDF_PATH =", os.getenv("WKHTMLTOPDF_PATH"))
```

You should see:

```
WKHTMLTOPDF_PATH = C:\Program Files\wkhtmltopdf\bin\wkhtmltopdf.exe
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

- **PDF not generating?**
  - Ensure the environment variable is set **as a user variable**, not system-wide (unless you know what you're doing).
  - Make sure the path is correct and points to `wkhtmltopdf.exe`.
  - Restart your terminal or editor after setting the variable.

- **Still not working?**  
  - You can also manually pass the path in code:

```python
import pdfkit
config = pdfkit.configuration(wkhtmltopdf=r"C:\Program Files\wkhtmltopdf\bin\wkhtmltopdf.exe")
pdfkit.from_file("input.html", "output.pdf", configuration=config)
```

---

## üßº Project Integration

In this project, the script looks for the path automatically via:

```python
wkhtmltopdf_path = os.getenv("WKHTMLTOPDF_PATH")
```

If found, it uses the path to configure `pdfkit`.  
If not found, it falls back to the system default.

---

‚úÖ Once this is working, your pipeline will automatically generate PDF reports in the `/reports` folder.
